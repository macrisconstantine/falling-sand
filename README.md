# falling-sand
- Simple simulation of falling sand particles with simple HTML and JavaScript.
- Inspired by The Coding Train's video on coding falling sand.
- Open the website link to the right to try it for yourself using the mouse to spawn sand particles.
- Current code is extremely unoptimized and slows down dramatically after enough sand falls.

- TODO: Add a version two where u follow his video to make a less stupid and simpler sand simulator
- TODO: Add a graphical representation of how many computations are happening (show why your code is garbage)
- TODO: Stop being depressed.
- TODO: Change everything to snap to a grid so that everything is more aesthetic and efficient.
